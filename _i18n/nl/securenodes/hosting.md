One of the first security features of ZenCash was the encryption of the inter-node communications. This was deployed, and now ZenCash node communication looks like any other encrypted Internet traffic, instead of like Bitcoin traffic. This helps to hide the type of activity taking place, making it less likely that ZenCash users and nodes are blocked.

For reliability, we want thousands of secure nodes all over the world that users can connect to quickly and easily, and are willing to provide compensation to the node operators. If we have an extensive, distributed, and reliable network, people can use ZenCash no matter what happens. Secure Nodes enable the security and reliability of the ZenCash system.
