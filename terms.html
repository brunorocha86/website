        <p>
          This site is operated by Zen Blockchain Foundation (“ZenCash”), a Delaware non-profit corporation. The products and services offered by ZenCash, including, but not limited to, its websites, forums, help desks, documentation, software, wallets, and hosting services (the “Services”) may only be used for legal purposes.

ZenCash reserves the right to post changes to the Terms at any time, and by your continued use of the Services thereafter, you agree to be bound by the new version of the Terms. If any changes to the Terms are not acceptable to you, you must stop your use of the Services. In these Terms, "User", "you" and/or “your” refers to each user of our Services. "ZEN" refers to the digital currency that can be used in conjunction with our Services.

        </ul>
        <p>
          Without limiting any of those representations or warranties, ZenCash has the right (though not the obligation) in ZenCash’s sole discretion to (i) refuse or remove any content that, in ZenCash’s reasonable opinion, violates any ZenCash policy or is in any way harmful or objectionable, or (ii) terminate or deny access to and use of the Service to any individual or entity for any reason. ZenCash will have no obligation to provide a refund of any amounts previously paid.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Third Party Content</h2>
        <p>
          Any testimonials, opinions, advice, product or service offers, or other information or content made available on or through the Services by third parties ("Third Party Content") are solely those of their respective providers and not of ZenCash which does not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, reliability or usefulness of Third Party Content.

        <h2>9. Offsite Links</h2>
        <p>
          As a convenience to Users, ZenCash may provide links to other sites or resources. Because ZenCash does not have control over such sites and resources, ZenCash is not responsible or liable for use of or reliance on any content, products, services or information at such sites or resources.

        <h2>10. Viruses and Malware</h2>
        <p>
          ZenCash does not guarantee that files available for downloading will be free of infection or viruses or other code that may have contaminating or destructive properties.

        </p>

        <h2>11. Password Protected Areas</h2>
        <p>
          Some ZenCash Services may be password protected and available only to Users who are registered ("Password Protected Areas").

        </p>

        <h2>12. Privacy</h2>
        <p>
          The Services may collect personal information from Users. Because ZenCash respects the privacy of its Users and their personal information, it has established a Privacy Policy to describe what information it collects and how that information is used. ZenCash’s Privacy Policy can be found at https://zencash.com/privacy. If you elect to leave our Services via a third party link, including ZenCash social media forums like YouTube, Reddit, Facebook etc., the terms and conditions (including privacy polices) of those sites may differ significantly from the Terms found herein.
        </p>

        <h2>13. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</h2>
        <p>
          THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS-IS.” ZENCASH DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, REPRESENTATIONS AND CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, WITH RESPECT TO THE USE OF THE SERVICES, OR THE ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS, TIMELINESS OR CURRENTNESS OF ITS CONTENT, IN ANY WAY AND FOR ANY PURPOSE.
        </p>

        <h2>14. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h2>
        <p>
          IN NO EVENT WILL ZENCASH, ITS DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, CONTRACTORS, AGENTS BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY OR INDIRECT DAMAGES EVEN IF ZENCASH HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES OR ANY DIRECT DAMAGES THAT RESULT FROM: (1) THE USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE, THE SERVICES; (2) THE PERFORMANCE OF THE SERVICES; OR (3) ANY FAILURE IN THE SERVICES. USER ASSUMES TOTAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE USE OF THE SERVICES. USER’S ONLY REMEDY FOR DISSATISFACTION WITH THE SERICES IS TO STOP USING THE SERVICES. IF, NOTWITHSTANDING THE TERMS HEREIN, ZENCASH IS FOUND LIABLE TO USER FOR ANY DAMAGE OR LOSS WHICH ARISES OUT OF OR IS ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH USER’S USE OF THE SERVICES, ZENCASH’S LAIBLITY SHALL IN NO EVENT EXCEED THE AMOUNT PAID BY USER TO ZENCASH DURING THE PREVIOUS TWELVE (12) MONTHS. IN ADDITION TO THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY, USER AGREES THAT USER WILL NOT JOIN ANY CLAIM AGAINST ZENCASH WITH THE CLAIM OF ANY OTHER PERSON OR ENTITY IN A LAWSUIT, ARBITRATION OR OTHER PROCEEDING; THAT NO CLAIM USER HAS AGAINST ZENCASH SHALL BE RESOLVED ON A CLASS-WIDE BASIS; AND THAT USER WILL NOT ASSERT A CLAIM IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY AGAINST ZENCASH ON BEHALF OF ANYONE ELSE.
        </p>

        <h2>15. EXCLUSION OF LIMITATIONS AND DISCLAIMERS</h2>
        <p>
          BECAUSE SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES, OR THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, IN SUCH JURISDICTIONS ZENCASH'S LIABILITY IS LIMITED TO THE GREATEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.
        </p>

        <h2>16. Indemnification</h2>
        <p>
          User agrees to defend, indemnify, hold harmless and defend ZenCash and its directors, officers, employees, contractors, agents, subsidiaries, affiliates, licensors and suppliers from and against any and all claims, charges, complaints, damages, losses, liabilities, costs and expenses (including attorneys’ fees and expert fees) due to, arising out of or relating in any way to User’s use of, or access to, the Services.

No right or remedy conferred by these Terms is exclusive of any other right or remedy conferred herein or by law or in equity; rather, all of such rights and remedies are cumulative of every other such right or remedy and may be exercised concurrently or separately from time-to-time.</li>
          <li>Any ambiguities herein will not be strictly construed against the drafter of the language concerned but will be resolved by applying the most reasonable interpretation under the circumstances, giving full consideration to the intentions of the parties at the time of contracting.
